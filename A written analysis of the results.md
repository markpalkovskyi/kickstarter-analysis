# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
    In this project we had to deal with pivot tables, filtering the data, creating line charts, using different types of formulas such as:(year()),countifs(),sum(),average function, and more. 
### Purpose
    The purpose of writing analysis in the readme is that here you can provide information about a data files you completed, it helps to organize your work when you have tons of files and for an easier way to find what are you looking for read me is the best way to save your work for later or just be sure that data is correctly by you or another person you working with by simply sharing or publishing your work or make changes to someone else's work. 
## Analysis and Challenges
    My biggest difficulty in this challenge was that I got overwhelmed and got too stressed at the beginning, and it was not a good idea to start, as it turned out everything was much easier than I thought but I also got stuck for a little in both outcomes.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    A Goal of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was to illustrate a visual pivot table and a line graph of how many "successful","failed",and "canceled" theater outcomes were made filtering only Parent Category and Years. By creating a line chart we can visualize easily the relationship between outcomes and launch months.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    A Goal of Outcomes Based on Goals was to illustrate a number of (successful,failed,cancled total of projects plus its percentage) for goal amount using only "plays" criteria by using formulas (Countifs() and Sum()). After that, we created a line chart to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful,failed, and canceled projects on the y-axis.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    In Deliverable #1 - the biggest challenge for me was filtering the pivot table fields, I did not understand fully which field name should I include in every 4 filters (columns,rows,values,and filters) but after a few tries and rewatching virtual class videos I can say I overcame it with no problem.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
      We can see that a visible surge of people going to the theaters starts in May through Jun and then slightly goes down in July and even more after then approximately stays at the same position through the whole year. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
        After creating a line graph we can see that successful percentage and failed percentage go in the same direction but from different goal-amount ranges, basically when successful percentage goes up, failed percentage goes down, and opposite. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
        In this case, there are some limitations such as a small data set, simple experience, or different types of chart for presentation; as an example.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
        we could make a regular column chart to visualize what graph would look better if we would like to make a presentation about these two particular discussions.
